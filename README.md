<h1 align="center">Student Performance Monitoring System</h1>

A web-based Student Performance Monitoring System developed with raw PHP,
designed to streamline academic performance tracking in educational institutions.  
The system features a Laravel-like architecture and utilizes [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php)
for secure database operations with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com),
along with modern styling through [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The application offers functionality including student profile management,
performance tracking with visual analytics, automated reporting systems,
and role-based access control for different stakeholders.  
Built during an internship at [Systech Digital Limited](https://www.systechdigital.com),
it demonstrates practical implementation of complex database relationships
and secure user authentication.

Key technical highlights include the use of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
for dependency management, integration of [spatie/browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot)
for PDF generation, and a carefully structured codebase that prioritizes maintainability and scalability.  
The system provides educators with tools for monitoring student progress,
generating insightful reports, and making data-driven decisions to improve educational outcomes.

The project showcases the ability to build applications using raw PHP
while maintaining clean code architecture and implementing modern development practices.
